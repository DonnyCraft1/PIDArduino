# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PIDArduino

PIDArduino is an open source project and we love to recieve cotributions from our community - you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature request or writing code for the actual library.

# Rules

* **ยง1:** Before submitting an issue, research to ensure it hasn't been submitted before. Avoid duplicate issues

* **ยง2:** Use common sense

# Getting started

*Please do not edit the master branch, always use the [develop](https://github.com/DonnyCraft1/PIDArduino/tree/develop) branch or a new feature branch when contributing!*

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the repo
2. Create a new branch from the develop branch called `feature/new-feature`, all lower-case and replacing `new-feature` with a descriptive name for the feature
3. Do the changes in *your* fork
4. If you like the fork and think the project could use it, consider a pull request

---

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch directly on the [develop](https://github.com/DonnyCraft1/PIDArduino/tree/develop) branch.

This includes:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
